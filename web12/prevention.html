<p style="font-size:30px;">You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:

     
<p style="font-size:30px;">•Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</br>*why?</br> Washing your hands with soap and water or using
alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">• Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself andanyone who is coughing or sneezing:</br>*Why?</br> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquiddroplets from their nose or mouth which may  contain virus.If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including theCOVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>

Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
can make you sick.

areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or

these areas. </p>
