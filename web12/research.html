<p style="font-size:30px;">Groups of coronaviruses have been described. Within each group, viruses are characterized by their host range and genome sequence. Coronaviruses have been identified in mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle and humans, and can cause a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases5,6. Three human coronaviruses have been studied in detail. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were identified in the mid-1960s, and are known to cause the common cold7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The recently identified SARS-CoV causes a life-threatening pneumonia, and is the most pathogenic human coronavirus identified thus far16,17,18. SARS-CoV is likely to reside in an animal reservoir, and has recently initiated the epidemic in humans through zoonotic transmission19,20.</p>


<p style="font-size:30px;">The new coronavirus that we present here was isolated from a child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. This was not an isolated case, as we identified the virus in clinical specimens from seven additional individuals, both infants and adults, during the last winter season. We also resolved the complete sequence of the viral genome, which revealed several unique features.</p>
